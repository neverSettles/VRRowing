# VRRowing
A virtual reality Unity environment simulating rowing outdoors on the water. 

This simulation uses the occulus quest to simulate outdoor rowing by the user's controllers being tied to virtual oars and 
the user is kept in a boat, so when the user lifts the oars up (The blades dip into the water) and applies an acceleration to the blades,
the boat that the user is in accerlates. 

Code Originally adopted from https://github.com/edwonia/VR-Row , but modified to add controller support for oars, and upgraded packages for
oculus quest to work with the simulation.
